# Automated Teller Machine(ATM) prototype using LPC-2148 Development Kit

Project Overview:

This is a prototype machine designed from LPC 2148 ARM Cortex Development board, where the user with the account in the bank can withdraw, deposit & check his balance by entering the appropriate credentials.
Various Sensors where interfaced with the LPC 2148 like Buzzer, Smoke detector, Force sensitive resistors(FSR's) to detect any malpractices involved.

This project contains some files written in ALP(Assembly Language Programming) for UART, LCD and other Interfaces connected.

The C source files have embedded C into the picture, executed in keil software implemented in ARM based Microcontroller LPC 2148 for implementing the logic, business layer to it.

This is the course work project implemented during 4-5 th semester of my engineering days.
